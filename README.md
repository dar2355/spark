## What is it

This is an ambitious online tool created by fudgepop01.
It aims to be an online variant of PSA / PSACompressor. This will enable those on linux, mac, and windows to have a nice moveset-editing experience without using wine or any other tools of the sort.

## Planned Features

- an editor powered by Microsoft's Monaco Editor that will enable a development experience far-closer to an IDE with:
  - autocompletion
  - code-hints
  - preprocessor scripts
    - these would allow for named variables, for instance
  - automatic indentation
  - syntax highlighting
- built-in documentation
  - usage of variables will be shown globally
    - the recognized ones will have a description of what it stands for / does
  - each script can have user-created documentation (comes as a separate .txt file when downloaded)
- a fully configurable syntax
  - if the defaults aren't your thing, change the config files and voilÃ 
    - ex. AsyncTimer() ==> Asynchronous Timer()
- labelled bone IDs
